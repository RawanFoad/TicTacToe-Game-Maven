Technology:
***********
- Used Java programming language, JUnit4 jar, Eclipse Java EE IDE Version: Kepler Service Release 2
- Maven Project is used to define project's structure, add any new dependencies quickly and test management

Software design:
****************
-	class TicTacToe has main function
		> Singleton design pattern is used here to ensure that only one instance of game is created in JVM.
-	class TicTacToeController states the general steps of the process
		> for more readable code
-	abstract class TicTacToePlayer has common functions and attributes of players.
	classes TicTacToeComputerPlayer & TicTacToeUserPlayer extend abstract class TicTacToePlayer 
		> Factory design pattern is used to here to make code extendable without changing the code.
		> helps in having more than 1 player easily and in adding more congifurations for players if needed.

To run the code:
****************
1) Clone project
2) Compile
3) Go to class TicTacToe.java & run as Java Application
